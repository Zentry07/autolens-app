## App Review Notes (for Apple reviewers)

This app uses the device camera to photograph vehicles. Photos are sent to a cloud AI service (via a secure backend proxy) for real-time analysis. The AI identifies the vehicle and provides estimated market data. No photos are stored after processing.

Demo account: Not applicable (no login required).

AI Processing: Users must grant explicit AI processing consent on first use. This can be revoked in Settings.

In-app purchases use RevenueCat for subscription management. The free tier allows 3 scans per week. Pro removes this limit and unlocks additional features.
