  <p>This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and AutoLens for the use of the AutoLens mobile application ("App"). By installing or using the App, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA.</p>

  <h2>1. License Grant</h2>

  <h2>2. Scope of License</h2>
  <p>This license does not allow you to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Distribute or make the App available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time</li>
    <li>Rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the App</li>
    <li>Copy, decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the App</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. AI-Powered Features</h2>
  <p>The App uses artificial intelligence to analyze vehicle images and provide information. You acknowledge that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies</li>
    <li>Vehicle identifications, ratings, and cost estimates are approximate</li>
    <li>The App should not be used as the sole basis for purchasing or safety decisions</li>
    <li>Photos submitted for analysis are processed by third-party AI services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Subscription Terms</h2>
  <p>AutoLens Pro is available as an auto-renewable subscription. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

  <h2>6. Termination</h2>
  <p>This EULA is effective until terminated by you or AutoLens. Your rights under this EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, you shall cease all use of the App and delete all copies.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. AUTOLENS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

  <h2>10. Apple's Role</h2>
  <p>You acknowledge that this EULA is between you and AutoLens only, and not with Apple. AutoLens, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App and its content. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services with respect to the App.</p>
