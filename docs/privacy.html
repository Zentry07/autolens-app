  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

  <p>AutoLens ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the AutoLens mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Photos and Images:</strong> When you use AutoLens to scan a car, the photos you take or upload are sent to our AI processing service (Anthropic) for vehicle identification and analysis. These images are processed in real-time and are not stored on our servers after analysis is complete.</p>
  <p><strong>VIN Numbers:</strong> If you use the VIN decoder feature, the VIN you enter is sent to our AI service for analysis. VINs are not stored after processing.</p>
  <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage analytics to improve the app experience, such as which features are used most frequently. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
  <p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to AutoLens Pro, your purchase is processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. We receive only a confirmation of your subscription status.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p><strong>Anthropic (AI Processing):</strong> Car photos and queries are sent to Anthropic's API for AI-powered analysis. Anthropic processes this data according to their privacy policy and does not use your data to train their models. Images are not retained after processing.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Photos and queries sent for AI analysis are processed in real-time and are not stored after the analysis is complete. Local data on your device is retained until you delete it through the app's Settings.</p>
